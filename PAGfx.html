	<h1> PAGfx </h1>
	PAGfx is a tool used for converting graphics to be able to be used with PAlib. Or basically it converts the graphics to a format that the Nintendo DS can use. It is basically grit renamed with more source<br>
	<h1> The PAGC frontend </h1>
	The PAGc frontend is a UI for PAGfx that sets up the config file for convertion, it allow you to select the files. </p>
	<h1> You can use PAGfx on libnds but it is not recomended as it may cause corrupt graphics </h1>
	<h1> This is how PAGfx works. </h1><br>
	First of all it dectects a file called "PAGfx.ini", it contains the directory of the files and the configuration itself.<br>
	Next it creates a file called "all_gfx.h", it contains all the image definitions. For older PAGfx versions it creates also a all_gfx.c file.</p>
	For each image PAGfx creates a C file with the name of the image that was converted. It contains some definitions.</p>
	for Backgrounds it creates a <a href="PABgStruct.html"> PA_BgStruct </a> struct and defines everything.<br>
	for sprites it creates a C file containing the variables needed for the PAlib.</p>
