  <h1> How does PAlib/dsgmLib reduce parameters when loading a background </h1></p>
  PAGfx converts the C file, with the propierties that you need, and when you use PA_LoadBackground, you are not inputing the true bg,
  you input the PA_BgStruct struct that includes the name, the width, the height, the bg type and anything else you would expect.</p>
  
  For dsgmLib, dsgmGfx does a similar job, if its not then it is exactly the same.
