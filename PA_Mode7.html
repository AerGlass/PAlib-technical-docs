  <h1> PAlib Mode7 </h1>
  Mode7 is a way to faking 3D, it works by scaling and moving a background until it has depth.
  it is horribly bad and it was considered bloat, I do not know exactly which games use this but yeah. This won't ever
  be implemented in PA2lib unless anybody else is willing to take the risks of the library being called bloatware.</p>
  
  <h1>How does PA_Mode7 work?</h1></p>
  It looks pretty complicated but it is not, you don't actually use it.<br>
okay i lied.</p>
  some things that i found about was the PA_Mode7 was just fancy VBL stuff. Would I say easier? no lol. it look horribly bad and involves a bit of setup,
most of which you won't ever use.<br><br>

Here is proof that it is fancy VBL/IRQ stuff<br>
<code>
  
void PA_InitMode7(u8 bg_select) {<br>
	mode7cam_x = X0; mode7cam_y = Y0; mode7cam_z = Z0;<br>
	mode7alpha = 0;<br>
	mode7cos = 256; mode7sin = 0;	// temporaries for cos and sin alpha<br>
	mode7_distance = 160;<br>
//PA_StartInt(INT_HBLANK, hbl_mode7);<br>
	irqSet(IRQ_HBLANK, hbl_mode7);<br>
	irqEnable(IRQ_HBLANK);<br>
}
</code><br>
now lets see hbl_mode7<br>
<code>
  void hbl_mode7(void) {<br>
	u8 screen = 0;<br>
	u8 bg = 3;<br>
	s32 ww, wcc, wss, wxr, wyr;<br>
//	ww= (mode7cam_y*DIV[REG_VCOUNT])>>12;		// .8*.16 /.12 = 20.12<br>
	s16 vc = REG_VCOUNT;<br>
<br>
	if (vc > 192) vc = 0;<br>
<br>
	ww = (mode7cam_y << 4) / (vc + 1);		// .8*.16 /.12 = 20.12<br>
	wcc = ww * mode7cos >> 5;					// .12*.8 /.5 = 17.15<br>
	wss = ww * mode7sin >> 5;					// .12*.8 /.5 = 17.15<br>
	// NOTE: when you do P * q0<br>
	// - for x-offset (q0_x): >>7, then *120<br>
	// - for y-offset (q0_y): *160, then >>7<br>
	// Bad things happen if you don't.<br>
	// horizontal scale and offset<br>
	wxr = 128 * (wcc >> 7);				// .8<br>
	wyr = (mode7_distance * wss) >> 7;				// .8<br>
	PA_BGXPA(screen, bg) = wcc >> 7;<br>
	PA_BGXX(screen, bg) = mode7cam_x - wxr + wyr;<br>
	// vertical scale and offset<br>
	wxr = 128 * (wss >> 7);				// .8<br>
	wyr = (mode7_distance * wcc) >> 7;				// .8<br>
	PA_BGXPC(screen, bg) = wss >> 7;<br>
	PA_BGXY(screen, bg) = mode7cam_z - wxr - wyr;<br>
	// REG_IF = INT_HBLANK;		// cleared by isr switchblock<br>
}
</code>
this is a ton loads more complicated but yeah, its just vbl stuff
